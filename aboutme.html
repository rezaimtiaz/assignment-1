One of the most popular destinations this winter was this beach resort<br> town of Cox's Bazar on the Bay of Bengal,<br> which drew sun-worshippers from as far away as Europe and Southeast Asia.<br>

<b><i>"Foreigners come here, but we cannot offer everything they need.<br> But still they enjoy the beach and of course the warmth of the people here,"</i></b> said<br> Mahbubul Alam Akash, who hires out colourful beach chairs and sun umbrellas. "A large<br>number of Bangladeshis crowd the town now and their number has been increasing over the past years... we will find time to breathe once the official tourism season is over."</p></div>
